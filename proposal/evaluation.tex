\section{Evaluation framework}\label{sec:evaluation}
For this project, we evaluate the performance of GPU implementation with that of CPU.
There is no training involved. Haar features, number of features in each stage are already determined.
We compare the execution time for face detection in an image on CPU and on GPU. As mentioned in Methodology section, we
parallilize three different portions in the algorithm. We will analyze the contribution of each of
the three sections parallelized for performance implications.
Since sufficient parallelism can be extracted in this image processing application, we hope to get
better performance on GPU.
