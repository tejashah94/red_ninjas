\section{Methodology }\label{sec:meth}
We try to list out some of the tools we are considering for our project and also the methodologies involved with those.

We plan to use existing RISCV LLVM toochain~\cite{nguyenlinux} as part of compiler framework. 
For low power core, we are considering a three stage pipeline SODOR core as it is power efficient compared to any standard VLIW core. 
For implementing individual modules, we want to use CHISEL~\cite{chisel2012} tool, which uses an embedded scala language to generate verilog code and C++ simulator
framework. Also, for our initial modeling phase, we used a trace based modeling tool TDG and we will be using the same for our further analysis.   

For evaluating PENN, we will be collecting performance, power and area statistics of the synthesized version and compare it with statistics 
given in the literature of DSA papers.
