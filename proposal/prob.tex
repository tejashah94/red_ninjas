\section{Problem}\label{sec:prob}

Dennard scaling and Moore's Law have helped to obtain increased performance and power benefits over generations of hardware. But with these trends slowing down, Domain Specific Accelerators are being explored to reap benefits in performance and power. Though it is possible to gain 10x to 1000x performance and energy benefits by using DSAs over general purpose processors, they are limited by compromised programmability, obsoletion due to domain volatility, recurring design and verification costs and large area they take. This necessitates the need for Programmable accelerators. 
We would like to exploit the general underlying principles in DSAs like concurrency, specialized computation units, communication, data re-use and co-ordination, and use them to design a Programmable microarchitecture. Our aim for the project is to design microarchitecture and tool-chains required for the programmable accelerator and compare it with the results of a Domain Specific Accelerator. We will limit our study to neural processing algorithms on our programmable accelerator for this project as most of the image processing and media processing applications make use of neural networks. Hence we propose Programmable Engine for Neural Networks (PENN).
