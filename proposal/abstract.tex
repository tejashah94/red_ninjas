Applications with large amount of data level parallelism can benefit from 
General Purpose based Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) and have better energy
efficiency and performance compared to a CPU. 
Due to the nature of the graphics workloads, computer vision algorithms can better utilize the large 
number of cores in GPU, and hence meet the real-time requirements of the applications. One such application is Face Detection. 
Sequential processing of image windows with classifiers on CPU is difficult to meet the real-time requirements.
In this project, we implement Face Detection acceleration algorithm based on the Viola-Jones cascade classifier 
in the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform. We consider different portions of the algorithm that can be parallelized. 
We feed an image as input to the GPU where it is processed according to the algorithm and a rectangle is drawn on the image when 
face is detected. We finally compare the execution of the same algorithm on the CPU and analyze the gains from the GPU.
