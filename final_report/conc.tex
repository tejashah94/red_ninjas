\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

Face detection was a good candidate for parallelism and our project aimed to 
implement it on GPU. We found out that face detection algorithm has goo amount of data and
thread level parallelism and implemented three portions of the algorithm. Over the course, we found bottlenecks associated with each of the kernel
and added optimizations for them. We compare our GPU implementation performance with that of single threaded CPU version.
We achieve an overall speedup of 5.35x compared to CPU with all the optimizations added. We believe that with more robust version of the algorithm 
and more optimizations we can still achieve a better speedup.
