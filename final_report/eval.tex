For this project, we evaluate the performance of GPGPU im-
plementation with that of a CPU. We are not considering the
classifier training and are directly taking a CPU version of
trained classifier. Haar features, number of features in each
stage are already determined. We aim to compare the exe-
cution time for face detection in an image on CPU and on
GPU. As mentioned in Section 3, we parallelize three different
portions in the algorithm. We will analyze the contribution of
each of the three sections parallelized for performance impli-
cations and try to characterize the bottlenecks associated with
each sections of the algorithm. Since sufficient parallelism
can be extracted in this image processing application, we hope
to get better performance on GPU.
For profiling and bottleneck analysis, we aim to use
NVIDIA Visual Profiler~\cite{rosen2013visual} and then take corresponding de-
cisions for performance boost. For evaluating against CPU,
we plan to use the Euler supported multi-core processor node.
We use CUDA events~\cite{wilt2013cuda} for timing analysis of GPGPU and
CPU execution. We also plan to report the memory bandwidth
usage for execution on both platforms.
